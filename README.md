# Symbolic regression with deep neural networks

Written by Ben Moseley, April 2025.

In this workshop we will train **deep neural networks** to carry out **symbolic regression**. This workshop is inspired by these papers: [Deep Learning for Symbolic Mathematics, Lample and Charton, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01412) and [End-to-end symbolic regression with transformers, Kamienny et al, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10532).

The workshop is split into 3 parts:
 - Part 1: Understanding mathematical expressions and how to generate them
 - Part 2: Generating a training dataset of expressions and tokenization
 - Part 3: Training a deep neural network to carry out symbolic regression

# Assessment

You will be assessed on **your completion of each task in this notebook**. Each task is labelled like this:
 > **Task 0.0**: Complete this!

 Please fill in your code in the cell provided below each task.


# Goal

The goal of this workshop is to train a network to identify a mathematical expression given example data points from the expression. More precisely, given a dataset, $\mathscr{D} = \{(x_0, f(x_0)), \dots, (x_N, f(x_N))\}$, consisting of $N$ observed data points from a unknown function $f(x)$, can we predict the underlying **mathematical expression** for $f(x)$?

Note:
- We are not just doing function fitting! In function fitting, we want to predict the **value** of $f$ given $\mathscr{D}$. In symbolic regression we want to discover the underlying **mathematical expression** of $f$ given $\mathscr{D}$. This means the network must predict an **expression**.
- For simplicity, we only consider **scalar** (1D) functions with a single **input variable** ($x$) and **integer** constant coefficients. It is a fun task to extend the methods in this notebook to higher dimensions with floating point constants!

# Approach

We will use a deep neural network to **directly predict $f(x)$ given $\mathscr{D}$ as input to the network**, as shown below:

In Part 2 we will explain how to enable the network to directly predict symbolic expressions by using **tokenization** and **autoregressive prediction**.
