More precisely, given a dataset, $\\mathscr{D} = \\{(x_0, f(x_0)), \\dots, (x_N, f(x_N))\\}$, consisting of $N$ observed data points from a unknown function $f(x)$, can we predict the underlying **mathematical expression** for $f(x)$?\n",

        "Note:\n",
        "- We are not just doing function fitting! In function fitting, we want to predict the **value** of $f$ given $\\mathscr{D}$. In symbolic regression we want to discover the underlying **mathematical expression** of $f$ given $\\mathscr{D}$. This means the network must predict an **expression**.\n",
        "- For simplicity, we only consider **scalar** (1D) functions with a single **input variable** ($x$) and **integer** constant coefficients. It is a fun task to extend the methods in this notebook to higher dimensions with floating point constants!\n",

        "# Approach\n",
